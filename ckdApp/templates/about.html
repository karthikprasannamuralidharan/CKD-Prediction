                        <h2>Chronic Kidney Disease</h2>
                <p>Chronic kidney disease includes conditions that damage your kidneys and decrease their ability to keep you healthy by filtering wastes from your blood. If kidney disease worsens, wastes can build to high levels in your blood and make you feel sick.
                    You may develop complications like: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>high blood pressure</li>
                        <li>anemia</li>
                        <li>weak bones</li>
                        <li>poor nutrition health</li>
                        <li>nerve damage</li>
                    </ul>
                    Kidney disease also increases your risk of having heart and blood vessel disease. These problems may happen slowly over a long time. Early detection and treatment can often keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse. When kidney disease progresses, it may eventually lead to kidney failure, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to maintain life.</p>
